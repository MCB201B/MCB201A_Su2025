    "This set of 'experiments' that go along with MCB201A assumes that you have no prior experience with bioinformatics, particularly navigating a Jupyter Hub, Python, or data analysis. So the goal of Experiment 16 will be to introduce you to the basics of the UC Berkeley computing infrastructure, specifically the Biology Hub because you'll be making extensive use of it during MCB201B. You'll also learn some basics of Python as part of Experiment 16 to get you a bit more comfortable thinking about the logical foundations of Python. If you have any questions during lab sessions, don't hesitate to ask questions. For those of you with previous experience, feel free to help out your classmates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment 16 (and MCB201B) will make use of Jupyter, which is an open-source, online computing platform that allows you to write and run code for data analysis. Jupyter supports multiple languages including Python and R. You can create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and text. UC Berkeley's JupyterHub service provides you with the computational infrastructure to help lower the activation energy to getting started because it already comes with resources for data analysis, and particularly relevant for us is the Biology Hub, which contains a lot of pre-installed libraries and packages for bioinformatics. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook today will go along with the lecture \"Intro to the Biology Hub\" to help reinforce what was covered during lecture and to give you additional opportunities to play around in the Biology Hub environment and familiarize yourself with its structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "If at anytime, you need to redownload the original version of a notebook for this class, you can simply pull the GitHub repo for this class again, and you'll have both the original version and your version."
