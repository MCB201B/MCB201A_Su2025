Then the specified operation <code>print(i)</code> is performed. Once the operation is completed, the notebook checks to see if there are additional elements in the list, and if there are, then it moves to the next element in the list, which in this case would be <code>1</code>, and assigns it to the variable <code>i</code> and repeats the operation <code>print(i)</code>.
